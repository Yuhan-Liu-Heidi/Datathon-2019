# Datathon 2019 -- Predicting Rare Events
## Background

In digital advertising, a “conversion” refers to the event when the 
shopper clicks on the ad and performs a valuable action such as signup, 
registration, or makes a purchase.  Since “conversion” is a measurable 
event, it represents a reasonable proxy for the number of customers 
acquired during the ad campaign.  Increasingly, brands and agencies 
looking to put a value on the Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) require
marketers such as us to optimize the ad spend such that customer 
acquisition is maximized.

In order to wisely spend the limited marketing dollars, we need to 
identify the shoppers who are more likely to respond to our ad and 
convert.  While the number of devices to target is nearly one billion, 
the number of conversion events range from just a few hundreds to few 
thousands during the period of the ad campaign.  In other words, these 
conversion events are extremely rare.
